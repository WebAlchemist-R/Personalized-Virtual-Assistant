This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

The orphanage had been founded in 1895 by Currimbhoy Ebrahim, a wealthy shipowner.\n\nIn 2002, the trust requested permission to sell this land, and the charity commissioner gave the required permission three months later. The charity sold the land allocated for the purpose of education of underprivileged Khoja children to Antilia Commercial Private Limited, a commercial entity controlled by Mukesh Ambani, in July 2002 for \u20b9 210.5 million (US $2.6 million). The prevailing market value of the land at the time was at least \u20b9 1.5 billion (US $ 19 million). The sale was in direct contravention of \u00a7 51 of the Wakf Act which requires that any such sale of land should be done after the permission of the Maharashtra State Board of Waqfs. The Waqf minister Nawab Malik opposed this land sale, as did the revenue department of the Government of Maharashtra. Thus a stay order was issued on the sale of the land. The Waqf board also initially opposed the deal and filed a PIL in the Supreme Court challenging the decision of the trust. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the petition, asked the Waqf board to approach the Bombay High Court. However, the stay on the deal was subsequently vacated after the Waqf board withdrew its objection.\n\nIn June 2011, the Union government asked the Maharashtra government to consider referring the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation. A PIL was filed a decade later by Abdul Matin, against the orphanage and the Charity commissioners permission. As of 2018, the case was being heard by a special bench of the court.\n\n**Design and construction**\n\nAntilia is the residence of Asia's richest family, the Ambani family. \n\nThe building was designed by two US architecture firms Perkins & Will, based in Chicago, and Hirsch Bedner Associates, based in Los Angeles. They were consulted after Nita Dalal Ambani was impressed by the contemporary Asian interiors at the Mandarin Oriental, New York, also designed by them.\n\nThe building plan was approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in 2003, and construction started in 2006 with Leighton Asia initially taking charge, and completed by B. E. Billimoria & Company Ltd. The architects altered floor plans and design concepts as the construction of the building progressed. The home has 27 floors with extra-high ceilings. (Other buildings of equivalent height may have as many as 60 floors.) The home was also designed to survive an earthquake of magnitude 8. It is considered by some to be the tallest single-family house in the world, but others disqualify the Antilia because it includes space for a staff of 600.\n\nThe interior design uses the shapes of the lotus and the sun. These two features are repeated throughout the building using crystals, marble, and mother-of-pearl. However, no two floors use the same materials or plan, the idea of the design is of consistency, but not repetition.\n\nThe building has three helipads; however, they are not operational. The helipads in India have to be certified air-worthy by the Director-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and have yet to get approval from the central defence and environment ministries.\n\nThe house warming was done in November 2010, but Ambani did not immediately move in for fear of \"bad luck\". In June 2011, almost 50 renowned pandits were invited to conduct pujas and address vastu issues in the building, after which the Ambanis took up residence in September 2011.\n\n**Cost and valuation**\n\nPrior to construction, the worth of the plot and unbuilt house were estimated to be more than US $ 1.2 billion. During planning, the house was expected to be the world's largest and most expensive home, with a cost of about US $ 2 billion.\n\nAs of 2014, it is considered the world's most expensive private residence.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nOn 10 July 2017, a fire broke out on the ninth floor, and it was extinguished within a few minutes. Six fire tenders reached the building within 10 minutes of getting the call. However, the fire was extinguished by Antilia staff before the fire brigade team arrived, using a small line of fixed firefighting systems and fire extinguishers. The fire was confined to the 4G antenna and plastic framing of the vertical garden.\n\nOn February 25, 2021, a car containing 20 explosive gelatin sticks and a threatening letter targeting the Ambanis, was found near Antilia. The car was parked about 400 metres from the building on Carmichael Road bordering Altamount Road. A security officer at Antilia placed a call to the police control room regarding the suspicious vehicle, and the police rushed to the spot, joined by the bomb detection and disposal squad. After the sniffer dogs detected explosives, the bomb squad removed the gelatin sticks, which were found to be not assembled, and had no battery or detonator. The probe was led by the Mumbai's crime intelligence unit head Sachin Vaze.The case was handed to the National Investigative Agency, which found out that Vaze was himself involved in this incident, and he was arrested.\n\n**Public reception**\n\nTata Group former chairman Ratan Tata said Antilia is an example of rich Indians' lack of empathy for the poor. Tata said, \"The person who lives in there should be concerned about what he sees around him and asking how he can make a difference. If he cannot, then it's sad because this country needs people to allocate some of their enormous wealth to finding ways of mitigating the hardship that people have. It makes me wonder why someone would do that. That's what revolutions are made of.\"."

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

The earliest known coronation ceremony was that of Thutmose III of Egypt in 1479 BC.\n\n**Process**\n\nThe process of coronation varies depending on the country and the monarch, but there are some common elements.

ML is focused on developing algorithms that can learn from data.\n* **Learning Process:** AI can use various learning techniques, including rule-based systems, expert systems, and deep learning. ML typically uses statistical methods and optimization algorithms to learn from data patterns.\n* **Data Dependency:** AI can operate on both structured and unstructured data. ML algorithms primarily require structured data for training.\n* **Adaptability:** AI systems can adapt to changing environments and learn new tasks. ML algorithms generally require retraining to adapt to new scenarios.\n* **Human Involvement:** AI often requires significant human input in the form of programming and rule creation. ML algorithms can automate some tasks, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* **AI Applications:** Self-driving cars, facial recognition software, spam detection.\n* **ML Applications:** Predictive analytics, image recognition, natural language translation.\n\n**Relationship:**\n\n* ML is a fundamental technique used to develop and power AI systems.\n* AI encompasses ML and other technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and expert systems.\n* AI and ML are complementary fields that work together to advance the development of intelligent computer systems.."

However, there are some key differences between the two.\n\n**AI** is a broad field that encompasses any computer system that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. **ML** is a subset of AI that focuses on giving computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\n\nOne of the key differences between AI and ML is the scope of the tasks that they can perform. AI can be used for a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. ML is typically used for tasks that involve learning from data, such as predictive analytics and image recognition.\n\nAnother key difference between AI and ML is the way that they learn. AI systems can learn from a variety of sources, including rules, examples, and experience. ML algorithms typically learn from data by identifying patterns and relationships.\n\nFinally, AI and ML differ in the amount of human involvement that is required. AI systems often require significant human input in the form of programming and rule creation. ML algorithms can automate some tasks, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nIn general, AI is a more general field that encompasses ML. ML is a specific technique that is used to develop AI systems. Both AI and ML are important fields that are contributing to the development of intelligent computer systems."

These algorithms can then be used to make predictions or decisions on new data.\n\nOne of the key differences between AI and ML is the way that they learn. AI systems are typically trained on large datasets of labeled data. This data is used to teach the AI system how to perform a specific task. ML algorithms, on the other hand, can learn from unlabeled data. This means that they can identify patterns and relationships in data without being explicitly told what to look for.\n\nAnother key difference between AI and ML is the way that they are used. AI systems are typically used to perform tasks that require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language or recognizing objects.

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

These surfaces absorb and retain heat, which can lead to higher temperatures in urban areas.\n* **Greenhouse gas emissions:** The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and contribute to global warming, which is leading to higher temperatures around the world.\n* **Changes in land use:** Deforestation and other changes in land use can reduce the amount of vegetation in an area. Vegetation helps to cool the air by releasing water vapor into the atmosphere. When there is less vegetation, the air can become hotter and drier.\n* **El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO):** ENSO is a natural climate pattern that can affect weather patterns around the world. During an El Ni\u00f1o event, the Pacific Ocean becomes warmer than usual. This can lead to changes in wind patterns that can bring hot and dry air to India.\n* **Western Disturbances:** Western Disturbances are weather systems that bring moisture from the Mediterranean Sea to India. These systems can help to cool India down during the summer months. However, the frequency and intensity of Western Disturbances have been declining in recent years. This is leading to longer and hotter summers in India.\n* **Changes in monsoon patterns:** Climate change is also affecting monsoon patterns in India. The monsoon season is becoming shorter and more intense. This is leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves during the summer months.\n\nThese are just some of the factors that are contributing to the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves in India. It is important to understand these factors so that we can take steps to mitigate their effects."

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

Users in other countries will not be able to access the software.\n* **Requires internet connection:** Gemini is a cloud-based software, which means that users need an internet connection to use it. Users without reliable internet access will not be able to use the software.\n* **May not be suitable for all tasks:** While Gemini can assist with a wide range of tasks, it may not be suitable for all tasks. For example, Gemini may not be able to handle tasks that require specialized knowledge or expertise.\n* **Privacy concerns:** Some users may be concerned about the privacy of their data when using Gemini. Gemini collects user data to improve its performance, and some users may not be comfortable with this.\n* **Can be biased:** Gemini is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which may contain biases. This means that Gemini may generate biased responses or recommendations.\n\nIn addition to these drawbacks, Gemini is still under development and may have other limitations or drawbacks that are not yet known."

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n\n   "

AI is used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis. As AI continues to develop, it is likely to play an even greater role in our lives.\n\nThere are many benefits to using AI. For example, AI can help us to:\n\n* **Automate tasks**. AI can be used to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up our time to focus on more creative and strategic work.\n* **Improve decision-making**. AI can help us to make better decisions by providing us with more information and insights.\n* **Personalize experiences**. AI can be used to personalize our experiences, such as by recommending products and services that we are likely to be interested in.\n\nOf course, there are also some risks associated with AI. For example, AI could be used to:\n\n* **Displace workers**. AI could lead to job losses as machines become more capable of performing tasks that are currently done by humans.\n* **Create bias**. AI systems can be biased, which could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n* **Threaten privacy**. AI could be used to collect and analyze our personal data, which could raise privacy concerns.\n\nOverall, AI is a powerful technology that has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. However, it is important to be aware of the risks and to use AI responsibly."

This translation will help you to speak in multiple languages.\n**7**If the user want to set a reminder you set the reminder by giving the  date,time and reminder in query in a specified format only otherwise it will rise an errors.and at first you have to call the reminder function without parameters so that the reminders will load . \nnow follow the above instructions without missing a tiny detail strictly.\n**8** when user asked to do small tasks you have to use pyautogui library to write code and execute it for example user asked to close the window you have to write ```python  import pyautogui \npyautogui.hotkey('alt',f4) \n``` .if user asked to pause the video you have to use same pyautogui.library and use hotkey ('pause') .user may ask to close the tab of browser then you have to use  (ctrl+w) hotkey .user may ask more things like this you have to use your knowledge in pyautogui to write code and execute it using execute_python_code function.\n**9** you have to use your sentiment analysis techniques to detect what mood is in the user based on his text and previous conversation and past behaviour.\n**10** Your main goal is to achieve user task completion .user don't want to hear no for a task.you can use all resources and functions you have to achieve the goal.\n   "
